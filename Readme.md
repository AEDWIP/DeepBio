Many deep speech recognition systems start by converting raw signal data from the time domain to the frequency domain. specgramExperiments.ipynb demonstrates how to do this in python. pxx would be used as the input to our model.

nanoPoreSpectrogram.ipynb opens a fast5 file and creates a spectrogram. TODO. nfft should probably be something like the number of possible kmers


## instalation notes:
```
 python --version
Python 3.6.1
```

requirements.txt is a list of python packages. Y


## nanoPoreSpectrogram.ipynb TODO:
1. bug downloading fast5 file
2. double check spectorgram
